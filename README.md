# ðŸ”¶ Lexer Setup Instructions
## You need to run View.java to display Lexer
To display the View.java window correctly, follow these steps in Eclipse:

1. Open Eclipse and ensure that the project containing View.java is already imported.
2. Locate the package or directory where View.java is present.
3. In the Package Explorer or Project Explorer view, find View.java and double-click on it to open the file.
4. Once the file is open, you should see the contents of View.java in the code editor.
5. To execute the View.java file and display the window, look for the "Run" button in the toolbar at the top of the Eclipse window. It typically resembles a green play button â–¶.
6. Click on the "Run" button or use the keyboard shortcut associated with running the program (usually Ctrl + F11 or Command + F11 on macOS).
7. Eclipse will then compile and run the View.java file, and the window defined in the code should appear on your screen.

Note: Ensure that all necessary dependencies and libraries are correctly configured for the project to avoid any compilation or runtime errors.
